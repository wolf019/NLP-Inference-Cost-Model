# Deriving an Natural Language Processing inference cost model with Greenhouse Gas accounting

Early studies have found that the energy cost of training one large Natural Language Processing model is significant and training one transformer model is estimated to generate approximately the same lifetime CO2 emissions as five average cars.

To develop machine learning and AI models responsibly, we ought to derive tools for the AI community to lower its greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption.
